# My Personal Website

This is the codebase for my personal website. The site is internally simple as I work primarily on projects and just don't have the time to maintain a fancy personal website.

## Running Locally

1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
2. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`

## Building For Production

1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
2. Build the site: `npm run build`
