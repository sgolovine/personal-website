# My Personal Website

This is the codebase for my personal website. The site is internally simple as I work primarily on projects and just don't have the time to maintain a fancy personal website.

## Running Locally

1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
2. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`

## Building For Production

1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
2. Build the site: `npm run build`

## Why is this site so simple?

Previous versions of my website have been far more sophisticated and complex, complete with blogs, snippets, contact sections and more. This version is intentionally simple because truth be told, I have other priorities now. Between all the other projects I currently maintain I hardly have time to update my personal site. Keeping this site in pure HTML with a low overhead keeps the maintainence required to a minimum.
