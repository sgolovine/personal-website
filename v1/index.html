    <h1>Sunny Golovine</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Sunny Golovine and I'm a software architect currently based
      in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver">Denver, CO</a>. I
      specialize in building full-stack applications in the cloud. When not
      working I like to get our and hike in Colorado as well as traveling around
      the US and the World, seeing places I've never seen before.
    </p>

      <h2>My Work</h2>
      <p>
        I graduated from
        <a href="https://www.georgiasouthern.edu/"
          >Georgia Southern University</a
        >
        in 2017 with a BA in Computer Science. Since then I have worked as a
        frontend developer and now as a full-stack developer. My main focus is
        building full stack applications with the latest technologies avaliable.
        I currently work as a Software Engineering Manager at
        <a href="https://ascendum.com/">Ascendum Solutions</a>.

              I've been using React for years and will continue using it for
              years to come. One of the most productive frontend frameworks for
              developing complex web applications.

              An extremely attractive option for quickly adding server side
              functionality. Very little overhead and lets you run server code
              without committing to any sort of capacity.

      <p>
        Whenever I'm not working, I try to get outside as much as possible. I'm
        an avid hiker and paddleboarder during the summer and an avid skiier
        during the winter months. I try to travel as much as possible, both
        within the United States and abroad when I get the time.
