      Over the years, I have gone through many iterations of my website
      (previous versions on Github:
      <a href="https://github.com/sgolovine/www-2018">2018</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/sgolovine/www-2019">2019</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/sgolovine/www-2020">2020</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/sgolovine/www-2021">2021</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/sgolovine/www-2022">2022</a>). And over those
      years a similar story has repeated itself: I spend tons of time building
      the site, I seldomly update the site because of other priorities, whenever
      I return there is a bucket list of things that need to be updated, and
      eventually I decide to completely rebuild the site using new technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I started my career in tech, I had ample time on my hands to write
      fancy personal websites, complete with all the latest development tools
      and the latest web development techniques. But as time has progressed,
      I've had less and less time to work on my personal website, leaving it to
      languish for months between updates, and each time I return there is a
      slew of upgrades that have to be made in order ot prevent "tool rot".
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in 2023 I realized that I just no longer have the time to make these
      upgrades and need a site that will work for years to come with minimal
      upgrades. So I made the decision to move to the most simplistic site I
      could imagine, just a plain collection of HTML files.
    </p>
    <p>
      While simple, the site is designed quite intentionally. The guiding
      principle of this website is to be "tool agnostic". A major recurring
      problem I've had with previous websites is not that the content of the
      site "rots" but rather that the tools that support the site "rot".
      Therefore this site is built with the assumption that tools will always
      change and that the site should only use technologies of the lowest common
      denominator. I fully expect new tools to become available in the next few
      years that will render current tools out of date. That is why this site
      very intentionally does not have any build process or special tools for
      running in development. To run this site in development, one simply has to
      serve the content from the "app" directory. How those files are served
      will change over time so no guidance is given beyond "serve the files".
      Similarly with hosting the site, I fully expect new and better web-hosts
      to come out over time so for deploying the site the only guidance is to
      "upload to a file host".
    </p>
    <p>
      This will be the last website rebuild that I do for quite some time. I'm
      working on much bigger and grander projects now that require much more of
      my time every day and this site just needs to "work". I expect some
      upgrades to take place over time but I want to adhere as much to the "tool
      agnostic" principle as possible.
