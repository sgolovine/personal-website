        Hi, my name is Sunny Golovine and I'm a software architect currently
        based in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver">Denver, CO</a>.
        I specialize in building full-stack applications in the cloud. When not
        working I like to get our and hike in Colorado as well as traveling
        around the US and the World, seeing places I've never seen before.
